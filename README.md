# Software Engineering Project Starter Code

The system will take a single positive integer and return its largest prime factor. For example, if the input is 13195, the prime factors are 5, 7, 13, and 29, so the output will be 29. If the input is 13, the output will be 13 since 13 is already prime. If the input is 1, there is no prime factor, so the system will return an error or a sentinel value.

## Multithreading
The upper bound I am using for maxThreads is 4.
